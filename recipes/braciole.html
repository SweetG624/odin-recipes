        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
                <li>In a medium-sized bowl, add the eggs, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes.</li>
                <li>Next add the Parmesan cheese, garlic, onion, parsley, spinach, and breadcrumbs. Stir the mixture well to combine. Set aside</li>
                <li>Place the flank steak on a cutting board and season it with salt and black pepper. Place a piece of parchment paper over the steak and pound it thin and evenly.</li>
                <li>Use your hands to spread out the breadcrumb mixture evenly over the steak, just to about one inch from the edges.</li>
                <li>Start at one of the long edges of the steak, and roll it up tightly like a log. Secure it with the pieces of butchers string.</li>
                <li>Add the oil to a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the log and brown it on all sides, about 3 minutes each. Stand up the log with tongs and brown each end, too.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato sauce to the pan. Lift up the log up to sit on the sauce. Spoon some of the sauce over the top of the log. Cover and cook for about an hour, turning the log halfway through the cooking time, and spooning some of the sauce over the top.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven. Allow to sit for a few minutes, remove the butchers string, then slice into 1-1/2-inch-thick pieces.</li>
                <li>Serve with your favorite pasta, garnished with parsley and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ol>
